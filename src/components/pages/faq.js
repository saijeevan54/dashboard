      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <br/>
      <p> <br/><br/>
      We’ve amassed a large number of frequently asked questions (FAQs) by new project managers and put them all here in our guide. While some of these terms and concepts may appear in the glossary, the FAQs allow us to dive a little deeper into each idea.
      </p><br/><br/>
     <p className="Question">What is Change Management in Project Management?</p> 
      <p>First off, change within the context of project management is anything that transforms or impacts projects, tasks, processes, structures, or even job functions. Therefore change management refers to the tools and processes you use to manage change within a project and its project team. More often than not, change management refers to overseeing your team to successfully incorporate change into their work to achieve the overall project objectives.

      <p className="Question">What is Risk in Project Management?</p> 
      <p>Risk is any unexpected event that can affect your project — for better or for worse. Risk can affect anything: people, processes, technology, and resources. This is an important distinction: risks are not the same as issues. Issues are things you know you’ll have to deal with, and may even have an idea of when they’ll occur, like a team member’s scheduled vacation, or a big spike in product demand around the holidays. What is risk in project management? Risks are events that might happen, and you may not be able to tell when. Like flu season hitting your team all at once, or a key product component being on backorder.
      <br></br><br/>
When determining what is a risk in project management, consider these five elements:<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>  Risk event: What might happen to affect your project?</li> <br/>
<li>  Risk timeframe: When is it likely to happen?</li> <br/>
<li>  Probability: What’s are the chances of it happening?</li> <br/>
<li>  Impact: What’s the expected outcome?</li> <br/>
<li>  Factors: What events might forewarn or trigger the risk event?</li> <br/>
<li>  Prepare a Risk Assessment to get a better understanding of the kinds of risks your project is facing and their possible consequences. If you want to learn how to manage risks in a project, read this article for a step-by-step guide to creating a risk assessment.

      <p className="Question">What Is Agile Methodology?</p> 
      <p>Agile methodology is an approach to project management that uses 4 key pillars and 12 principles to organize projects. Here’s an Agile methodology overview for everything you need to know about this approach.
      <br></br>
The 4 key pillars of the Agile Manifesto book are designed for valuing:
<br></br><br/>
<ul>
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li><br/>
<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li><br/>
<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li><br/>
<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li> <br/>
</ul><br/>
To define Agile, the method is based on the concept of ongoing waves or sprints of project planning and execution, enabling you to continuously adapt and mature your plan, scope, and design throughout the project. 
<br></br>
According to the Agile methodology definition, Agile projects require an iterative approach, which supports incremental, frequent, and consistent deliveries of workable products to your customer or client. This innovative approach ensures your project team can consistently deliver concrete products without being delayed by changes and evolving requirements.  
<br></br>
Agile has a high level of customer involvement and includes frequent reviews of progress with both the project team and the customer. 
<br></br>
There are several different frameworks that can be used in order to run an Agile project. Some of the more popular frameworks include:
<br></br><br/>
<li>Scrum</li>
<li>Kanban</li>
<li>Extreme Programming</li>
<li>DSDM</li>
</p><br/><br/>
      <p className="Question">Project Management Software overview</p> 
      <p>Uniting your team and preparing them to work as a unit is integral to the success of your projects. But without the proper project management software and tools to manage these projects, you may be doubling your efforts instead of optimizing them. By spending time maintaining dozens of spreadsheets and trying to stay on top of an overflowing inbox, you’re missing the opportunity to be strategic with your time. This is the importance of using the right tools for the job.

      <br/><br/><br/>
Below we tackle two general groups of tools that you should use for managing work more efficiently: your work management/collaboration tools and your personal productivity tools.
<br/>
Project management tools can vary from team to team, but they are more commonly used as computer programs enabling project managers to plan, execute and manage their projects in one centralized virtual location.
<br></br><br/>
Project management software can be used for any of the following:<br/>
<br></br>
<ol>
<li> Project planning</li> <br/>
<li>   Project scheduling</li> <br/>
<li>   Resource allocation and capacity planning</li> <br/>
<li>   Budgeting and monitoring project costs</li> <br/>
<li>   Quality management</li> <br/>
<li>   Storing and sharing documentation and project records</li> <br/>
<li>   Creating and publishing project reports </li> <br/>
<li>   Tracking the actual time spent on project tasks versus plan</li> <br/>
<li>   Analyzing trends and forecasting</li> <br/>
</ol></p><br/><br/>
      <p className="Question">Project Collaboration Tips for Teams</p> 
      <p>You’ve analyzed the various methodologies, chosen the frameworks most suited to your project, your team, and your objectives, and found a project management tool that fits your needs. Throughout the entire project life cycle, you’ll have to work with your individual team members to function as a cohesive unit.</p>
      <br/><br/>
      <p className="Question">How to Set Up a Project Team?</p>  
      <p>So, now that we’re on the same page about the value of collaboration, let’s take a step back and discuss what makes a project team and how you build one. Merely assigning people tasks is not the same as building a project team.
      <br/><br/>A project team is a group of people who are all working towards a common goal by bringing valuable and unique skills to the table. Identifying your project team members, defining your team’s identity, and standardizing its operating practices are all critical to a successful project.
      <br/><br/>So what should you consider when assembling your project team?<br/><br/>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Project Needs.</b> Understand the scope of the project first allows you to strategically choose who needs to be on the team.</li><br/>
      <li><b>Skill set.</b> Choosing team members who can offer a diverse set of unique and relevant skills is crucial. If your team lacks a certain skill set, a task may not be completed correctly. oo many people with the same skills can cause confusion over ownership.</li><br/>
      <li><b>Capacity.</b> Even if you find the perfect person for a part of your project, if they’re overloaded with work, they can become a roadblock. Find team members who have availability in their upcoming project schedules.</li><br/>
      <li><b>Work styles.</b> Different people have different work styles and personalities. It’s important to understand how these differences may affect your team dynamic and embrace them once the project has started.</li><br/>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <br/><br/>
      <p className="Question">What Makes a Successful Project Team?</p>  
      <p>Your project team can vary depending on project scope and skills needed, but the elements of a successful project team are more or less consistent across the board.</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Strong team leadership.</b> Every team needs a leader who can bring out the best in their teammates. Understanding each of your team members’ individual strengths and how to bring them out is vital to the success of the team as a whole.</li><br/>
      <li><b>Clear goals and purpose. </b>When the roadmap and goals are clear, it’s much easier for a team to see where they’re going and how their contribution will matter down the road. Encourage them to rally around your cause with a clear vision.</li><br/>
      <li><b>Standardized operating procedures.</b> When conflicts arise or a task needs to be assigned, teams need to know how to take action. Creating standard processes and workflows, along with clear roles eliminates confusion and empowers your team to blow past roadblocks.</li><br/>
      <li><b>Diversity. </b>Time and time again studies have shown that diversity improves performance. A strong project team will include a variety of skill sets, as well as a diversity of race, gender, and cultural backgrounds.</li><br/>
      <li><b>Bonding time.</b> Finding time for project team members to get to know each other and build a rapport helps build trust, breaks down barriers, and opens communication lanes. Finding time for team-building exercises and to celebrate victories, no matter how big or small, can go a long way. Getting everyone in the room at the start of the project for a kickoff helps everyone stay on the same page from the beginning.</li><br/>
      </ul>
